# AI-docs-assigment

Egor Ustinovich

Personal note first:
Hi, unfortunately I was not carefull reading the readme about using unittest and the priovided files so the assigment implemented on jupyter notebook.

There was no time for me to complete the implementation change(I can do it with additional day if it's possible of course).

I do tried to use the tdd approach, test for the assigment parts are defined in the notebook.

sorry for the inconvenience.


Notes about the notebook:

The notebook containes the implementation and the text answers after.

At a top of every cell there is a short description.

Tests implemented first.
